{% endraw %}-year-old computer science student at Sharif University of Technology, one of the most prestigious universities in Iran. He has a diverse academic background and a strong passion for machine learning and deep learning.

<!-- - He started his studies as an aerospace engineering student, where he learned about thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, and participated in the AIAA Design competition ([link](https://mamood.ir/blog/tag/aiaa/)).
- He switched to computer science, where he developed an interest in machine learning and deep learning applications to biology and bioinformatics. He is working on his bachelor project, which uses physics-informed deep learning to reconstruct fluxomic data ([link](#to_your_project)).
- He is also exploring natural language processing and large language models, but he is still new to these fields.

- He has experience in creating visual content, such as graphic design and video editing. He was the head of visual content of Gamein, Iran’s largest student event ([link](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gameinsharif/)).
- He has a curious mind that likes to find connections and patterns among different things. He is also good at presenting and managing teams.
- He is a creative person who loves various forms of art and expression. He writes poems in Persian and draws portraits ([link](#to_your_portfolio)). He also enjoys listening to instrumental music and reading Persian poems.

Amirhossein is looking for graduate positions that will allow him to pursue his passion for machine learning and deep learning, as well as to learn from and collaborate with other researchers and experts in the field. He is interested in working on topics such as physics-informed machine learning, bioinformatics, natural language processing, and large language models. He wants to apply his knowledge and skills to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on society.

<!-- **Amirhossein Mahmoudi** is a 23-year-old computer science student at Sharif University of Technology, one of the most prestigious universities in Iran. He started his academic journey as an aerospace engineering student, where he gained a solid background in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, as well as research and teamwork skills through participating in the [AIAA Design competition](https://mamood.ir/blog/tag/AIAA/). He then switched his major to computer science, where he developed a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning, especially in their applications to biology and bioinformatics. He is currently working on his bachelor project, which involves using physics-informed deep learning to reconstruct fluxomic data, Supervised by [Dr. Mojtaba Tefagh](https://sharif.edu/~mtefagh/index.html). He is also exploring the fields of natural language processing and large language models, although he is still a beginner in these areas. -->
