I am a computer science student at Sharif University of Technology. I am interested in machine learning, data science, bioinformatics, and related fields. I have participated in several prestigious competitions and projects, such as the AIAA aircraft and space design competitions, where I won the second place in the graduate team category. I have also published a paper on a novel regional jet family design. I have experience in teaching and working as a graphic designer and website manager for various events and clubs. I am proficient in various programming languages, tools, frameworks, and libraries. I enjoy visual arts and poetry as hobbies.
