[The Sharif Yarigaran Charity Club](http://yarigaran.sharif.ir) is a cultural and social club at the Sharif University of Technology in Iran. It was founded in 1997 with the aim of emphasizing the right to education for vulnerable children in society and raising awareness among students about social issues.

The club publishes a magazine called Kishe Mehr, which means “a bunch of kindness” in Persian. The magazine covers topics such as education, health, environment, art, literature, and culture. It also showcases the club’s activities and achievements in helping underprivileged children and communities.
