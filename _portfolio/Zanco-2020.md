I am excited to share my latest logo design project for Zanco Konkor Consulting Group, a company that provides educational and career guidance services. Zanco is a Kurdish word that means a place to learn, like a university. I wanted to capture this concept of learning and growth in my logo, so I used the Persian writing of the word Zanco as the main element. I also added some symbols that represent the tools and environment of a student, such as a laptop, a pencil case, and a desk lamp.  I hope you like my logo design and feel free to leave your feedback in the comments.
