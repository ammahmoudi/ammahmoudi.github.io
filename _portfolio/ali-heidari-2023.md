Ali Heidari is a marketing manager who wanted a personal logo that reflects his identity and profession. I designed a logo for him that combines the letters A and H in both Persian and English. The logo also uses colors that match his personality and style.

The logo has a simple and elegant shape that can be easily recognized and remembered. The letters A and H are intertwined to create a harmonious and balanced design.

The colors of the logo are based on Ali Heidari’s preferences and characteristics. He likes soft warm colors, which are also associated with trust, calmness, and growth. These colors suit his role as a marketing manager, as he needs to communicate effectively and inspire confidence in his clients and colleagues.
The color palette was also inspired by the Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom from the movie Kung Fu Panda, which symbolizes wisdom, peace, and harmony.

The logo is suitable for various applications, such as business cards, websites, social media, and presentations. It represents Ali Heidari’s personal brand and showcases his professional skills and values.
