This logo was designed for an event called “Chay ba Ostad”, which means “Tea with Master” in Persian. The event is a welcoming and networking opportunity for new bachelor students in Sharif University of Technology to meet with their faculties and learn more about their academic programs and research interests. The logo combines the Persian phrase “Chay ba Ostad” with a tea pot, symbolizing the warm and friendly atmosphere of the event. The font and color choices reflect the elegance and prestige of the university, as well as the cultural heritage of Iran. The logo aims to convey a sense of curiosity, connection, and community among the students and the faculty members.☕️
