One of my recent projects was designing covers for Deraye, a magazine published by the Sharif Math [Hamband Scientific Society](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamband-student-scientific-society-5b9bb628b/), a student organization at Sharif University of Technology, one of the most prestigious and leading institutions for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields in Iran. Deraye is a magazine that covers various topics related to mathematics, such as history, philosophy, logic, combinatorics, graph theory, algebra, analysis, geometry, topology, and more. My goal was to create covers that reflect the theme and content of each issue, while also attracting the attention and curiosity of the readers. I used different elements, such as shapes, colors, fonts, images, and symbols, to convey the essence and beauty of mathematics. I also considered the aesthetic and cultural preferences of the target audience, which are mainly students and faculty members of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Sharif University of Technology. I am proud of the results and the positive feedback I received from the editors and the readers of Deraye.
