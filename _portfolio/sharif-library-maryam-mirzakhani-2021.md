This wallpaper is a tribute to [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani), a brilliant mathematician and a proud alumna of the Sharif University of Technology. Mirzakhani was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1977 and graduated from Sharif University in 1999 with a bachelor’s degree in mathematics. She then moved to the United States and earned her PhD from Harvard University in 2004. She became a professor at Stanford University in 2008 and made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of geometry, topology, and dynamical systems. In 2014, she was awarded the Fields Medal, the highest honor in mathematics, for her work on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. She was the first woman and the first Iranian to receive this award. She passed away in 2017 after a long battle with cancer, leaving behind a legacy of inspiration and excellence.

The wallpaper is designed with the handwriting extracted from Mirzakhani’s homework, which showcases her elegant and rigorous proofs and her creative and original ideas. The wallpaper also features a painting of Mirzakhani by [Alimohammad Parvaresh](https://www.instagram.com/alimohamad.art), a talented artist and a dear friend of mine. The painting captures Mirzakhani’s intelligence, curiosity, and passion for mathematics. The wallpaper is intended to decorate a wall in the Sharif University central library, where students can learn from Mirzakhani’s achievements and aspire to follow in her footsteps.

I created this wallpaper to express my admiration and respect for Mirzakhani, who was not only a brilliant mathematician but also a role model and a trailblazer for women and Iranians in science. I hope that this wallpaper will inspire and motivate future generations of mathematicians and scientists to pursue their dreams and make a positive impact on the world.
