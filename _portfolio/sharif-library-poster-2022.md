This poster template is designed for events in the library of Sharif University of Technology, one of the most prestigious and influential universities in Iran and the Middle East. The template is inspired by the paintings in some versions of the old famous Persian poetry legendary book [Shahnameh(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh)], or the Book of Kings, written by the poet [Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi) in the 10th and 11th centuries. The Shahnameh is considered to be one of the greatest literary works in the world, and a source of pride and identity for the Iranian people and culture.

The template features the line art pictures of three famous and distinguished figures who are related to the Sharif University of Technology and the Shahnameh. They are:

- [Maryam Mirzakhani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Mirzakhani), a brilliant mathematician and a proud alumna of the Sharif University of Technology. She was the first and only woman to win the Fields Medal, the most prestigious award in mathematics, in 2014. She made groundbreaking contributions to the fields of geometry, topology, and dynamical systems. She passed away in 2017 after a long battle with cancer, leaving behind a legacy of inspiration and excellence.

- [Dr. Mohammad Ali Mojtahedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Ali_Mojtahedi), a visionary engineer and educator, and the founder and first president of the Sharif University of Technology. He was instrumental in transforming the former Aryamehr University of Technology into a world-class institution of higher education and research. He died in 1998 after a car accident, leaving behind a legacy of innovation and excellence.


- [Ferdowsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi), the epic poet and the author of the Shahnameh. He is regarded as one of the greatest poets in the history of Persian literature and culture. He spent over three decades composing the Shahnameh, which consists of over 50,000 verses and covers the mythical and historical stories of the ancient Iranian kings and heroes. He is credited with preserving and revitalizing the Persian language and culture in the face of the Arab invasion and influence. He died in 1020, leaving behind a legacy of poetry and patriotism.
The vector line arts of Maryam Mirzakhani and Ferdowsi are based on paintings from my dear friend Alimohammad Parvaresh, a talented artist and a dear friend of mine. The paintings capture the essence and the spirit of these remarkable individuals and their achievements.
