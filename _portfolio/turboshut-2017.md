This logo was designed for Turboshut, a company that provides renewable energy solutions using wind turbines. The client wanted a logo that would convey their vision of creating infinite and sustainable power for the future, as well as their goal of shutting down the dependence on fossil fuels.

I started by sketching some ideas based on the keywords turbine, shut, infinity, and wind. I then chose a font that was modern and clean, and a color scheme that was fresh and green. I combined the letters T and S to form an infinity sign, and added a wind turbine icon inside the loop. I also adjusted the kerning and alignment of the text to create a balanced and harmonious logo.

The client was very satisfied with the final result, and praised the logo for being unique and memorable. They also appreciated the simplicity and clarity of the logo, which made it easy to use across different media and platforms.
