In May 2024, I traveled to Yerevan, Armenia, primarily for a US embassy appointment. Hereâ€™s a detailed account of my journey, which could be particularly helpful for students heading to Yerevan for visa purposes.

## Travel Dates and Accommodation
- **Travel Dates**: I departed from Tehran on May 5th and returned on May 9th.
- **Accommodation**: I booked a guest house on Noragyugh Street via [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/). The host, a kind old woman, made our stay very comfortable. Communication was a bit challenging as most locals do not speak English, but we managed with gestures and the help of local teenagers who acted as our translators.

## Arrival and Local Setup
- **SIM Cards and Currency Exchange**: Upon arrival at Yerevan airport, we bought SIM cards from [Team](https://www.telecomarmenia.am/en/) and exchanged some dollars for Armenian Drams (AMD). 

- **Transportation**: We installed the [Yandex Go app](https://go.yandex/) for rides to our guest house and for local transportation. While Yandex rides were convenient, they were expensive, so we often used public buses and the metro. Public transport cost 100 AMD per ride, payable in cash to the driver.

## Daily Essentials and Food
- **Local Shops**: Near our guest house, there were essential shops including grocery stores, hypermarkets, and printing facilities.
- **Restaurants**: We enjoyed meals at various places, with highlights being the delicious burgers at [Burgery Angus & More](https://www.yeremyanprojects.com/en/restaurants/burgery), albeit a bit pricey, and the delightful dishes at [Lavash Restaurant](https://www.yeremyanprojects.com/en/restaurants/lavash). Additionally, the local bread called Lavash, which cost around 110 AMD each, was a tasty and affordable treat.
