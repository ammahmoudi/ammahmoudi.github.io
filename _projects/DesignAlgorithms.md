Homework Solutions for Design Algorithm Course as Computer Science B.Sc. Student at Department of Mathematical Sciences, Sharif University of Technology.

Spring 2023

Supervisor: Dr Shahram Khazaei


## Description
This repostiry includes my homeworks and projects around Algorithms and Data structures.

## Table of Coding Problems
Each problem has a pdf file describing the problem in persian in format of an story.
Algorithms are supposed to be fast and efficient to accept the original problem restrcitions.
| Problem | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [BalancedParanthesisMinimumSwapsCounter](./BalancedParanthesisMinimumSwapsCounter) | Finding minimum swaps needed to balance an input string of parentheses |
| [ClosestPointsFinder](./ClosestPointsFinder) |Finding closest points on a 2d plane with different data structures in O(n log n) |
| [DiversityCoefficientFinding](./DiversityCoefficientFinding) | Calculating Diversity Coefficient among group of singers in a singing competition |
| [FarthestNodeFinder](./FarthestNodeFinder) | Finding farthest node from given starting node using dijkstra |
| [LongestCommonIncreasingSubsequence](./LongestCommonIncreasingSubsequence) | Finding Longest Common Incresing Subsequence between two strings using Dynamic Programming |
| [MaximumVerticalMarginClassifier](./MaximumVerticalMarginClassifier) | a simple sudo SVM Classifer wich only consider vertical distance (solved by LP) |
| [RookPlacingwithinAllowedArea](./RookPlacingwithinAllowedArea) | Placing Rooks in an N*N chess borad which each rook is allowed to place only in a specifed area without threatening other rooks |
| [SafeMST](./SafeMST) | indicate that a list of edges are all part of th MST of the given graph using some sudo-kruskal algorithm |
| [SafePathFinder](./SafePathFinder) | indicate that there is a safe path between start and end point in a graph which has some unsafe edges |
| [ShortestPathesToGraphBuilder](./ShortestPathesToGraphBuilder) | given a list of shortest path lengths between vertices and trying to make the smallest graph with this properties  |
| [TreeSplittingCounter](./TreeSplittingCounter) | given a tree, trying to count all combination of splitting this tree with some restrictions  |
## Theoritical Problems
There are some theoritical homeworks along with my solutions around the algorithm topics.(my answers may be incorrect!)
source book of the course:


Algorithms

Book by Christos Papadimitriou, Sanjoy Dasgupta, and Umesh Vazirani

The problems are in perisan but my answers are in english.
