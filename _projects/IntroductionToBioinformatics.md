## Description
This repository includes my homework and projects around Numerical Bioinformatics.
There are some problems from Rosalind implemented in Python and Java. Also, a small project about dimension reduction and AML is included.

## Table of Rosalind's Problems
24 Rosalind problems listed below are implemented as homework.
