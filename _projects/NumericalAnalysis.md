# Numerical Analysis
Homework Solutions for Numerical Analysis Course as Computer Science B.Sc. Student at Department of Mathematical Sciences, Sharif University of Technology.

Spring 2023

Supervisor: [Dr. Mohammad Reza Razvan](http://math.sharif.ir/faculties/razvan)


## Description
This repostiry includes my homeworks and projects around Numerical Analysis.
There are some theoritical questions and code implemenations around Numerical Methods.most of the questions are from source book of the course: [Numerical Analysis (R. Burden, Aires, A. Burden) [10th Ed.]](https://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burden-Numerical-Analysis-Hardcover/dp/B00SB3UL20).

(my answers may be incorrect!)

## Table of Implemenations
some questions are implemented in python in my homeworks.
