# Numerical Analysis
Homework Solutions for Numerical Analysis Course as Computer Science B.Sc. Student at Department of Mathematical Sciences, Sharif University of Technology.

Spring 2023

Supervisor: [Dr. Mohammad Reza Razvan](http://math.sharif.ir/faculties/razvan)


## Description
This repository includes my homework and projects around Numerical Analysis.
There are some theoretical questions and code implementations around Numerical Methods. Most of the questions are from the sourcebook of the course: [Numerical Analysis (R. Burden, Aires, A. Burden) [10th Ed.]](https://www.amazon.com/Richard-Burden-Numerical-Analysis-Hardcover/dp/B00SB3UL20).

(my answers may be incorrect!)

## Table of Implementations
some questions are implemented in Python in my homework.
