This project is a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project consists of two parts: a client and a server. The client is a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to enter numbers and operators and see the result. The server is a program that receives the calculation request from the client, performs the calculation, and sends back the result. The client and the server communicate using socket programming.

## Technologies

The project is written in Java and uses the following technologies:

- JavaFX: A framework for creating desktop applications with rich user interfaces.
- JFoenix: A library that provides material design components for JavaFX applications.
- Socket: A mechanism for creating a bidirectional communication channel between two processes over a network.

## How to run

To run the project, you need to have Java 8 or higher installed on your machine. You also need to have Gradle, a tool for managing Java dependencies and building Java projects.
