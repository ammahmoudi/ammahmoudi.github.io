## Project
The purpose of this [project](https://github.com/ammahmoudi/Stochastic-Processes/tree/main/project/) is to provide an in-depth analysis and application of various stochastic processes. It explores mathematical models and their real-world applications, highlighting key concepts and theories in stochastic processes. In this notebook, we delve into various fundamental and advanced concepts that underpin stochastic processes. We cover Gaussian distributions, Gaussian processes, Brownian motion, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, providing practical implementations and insights into each area.

### What You Will Learn and Do
1. **Gaussian Distributions**: You'll start with univariate and multivariate Gaussian distributions, learning how to fit these models to data and interpret the results.
2. **Gaussian Processes**: You will generate Gaussian processes using specific mean functions and kernels, visualizing different realizations to understand their variability.
3. **Brownian Motion**: Explore the characteristics of Brownian motion, simulate its trajectories, and apply detrending methods to analyze its behavior.
4. **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: Dive into MCMC, starting with a simple toy dataset and progressing to complex models. Learn about the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, understand how to set up and visualize MCMC chains, and extend your knowledge to fit quadratic models.

## Feedback
