Let’s focus on government actions. Suppose the government had to choose between two ways in which to support people whose jobs are no longer needed. The government could either give them enough money to live on until they find new jobs or offer them free job training without giving them money directly. Which of these two solutions do you think is better? Why?</p> <h4 id="andrew">Andrew</h4> <p>I believe that the government should prioritize providing free job training opportunities. Modern training programs are usually costly, which means that many people will not be able to afford them without the government’s funding. By participating in training programs, people will develop new, in-demand skills and become more competitive in the job market.</p> <h4 id="kelly">Kelly</h4> <p>Although I agree that having access to free training programs sounds promising, I think the government’s first step should be to give people enough money to live on until they find new jobs. This money will go directly into people’s pockets and allow them to make their own choices concerning their future.</p> <h4 id="response">Response</h4> <p><strong>This is a challenging topic, but I would have to agree with</strong> Andrew here. <strong>While I do understand Kelly’s concern about</strong> how providing money to unemployed people can help them survive, free job training opportunities allow them to earn skills that will help them get a job. If unemployed people rely on the government’s financial aid too much, they might never be able to earn money independently. <strong>I would also like to add something to</strong> Andrew <strong>’s comment</strong>. Technology is always advancing, so even if people find a job, they will have to improve their skills constantly. This means that the government will have to keep paying unemployed people, which can be costly. Training programs are beneficial because they can teach people how to learn job skills for themselves. Many people might never have the opportunity to learn these skills.</p> <h1 id="general-phrases">General Phrases</h1> <p>These are General phrases which could be used in both writing and speaking.</p>
